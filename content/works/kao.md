# Design system

You probably heard about design system, it seems like everybody in the design industry are talking about it now. It goes beyond traditional style guidelines by incoperating designs with creative technologiest to bulid up a sets of resuable components, guided by clear standards and can be assemble to implement any type of applciations. 


When I first joined the team, all our apps were built based on an open-source frameworks -- react-bootstrap. For developers it's a really convinient way to reuse as much as possible the code snippts. While it's not highly costomizable, and also not comply with the company branding, so we started with existing components and build up a refreshed design guideline and related interactive react components.

# Inventory then create style guides

I did a complete inventory of the exisiting applications first and took down all the UI elements, and distinguished those inconsistent ones. Then I worked on the basic style guides and created atomic elements based on guidelines. These atomics can be then assembled together to create different components in my design. That's what I called "3 levels of design guideline":

#### 3 levels of design guideline

1. **Basic styles**: Color,basic font style and 8px grid system were defined;

2. **Atomics**: Basic UI legos including buttons, forms, icons and etc were created according to the basic style guides;

3. **Components**:
Once the UI legos -- automics are ready, I started to use them in my design. While even though they might look consistent, but that doesn’t neccssaryly implies that assembled results will provide the same experience. Along my work, I always pay attention to repeated UX partterns, like "edit profile", "add new" and etc.. These repeated partterns and the way they were presendted by atomics consists of the Components. They should be properly documented why and when to use.

# Interactive front-end code snippts


# Evolutionary system

#### Voilà, it's there! But done? No!

Desgin system should serve as a guide instead of a dictator. Designers should refer to it when needed and also should be encourged to contribute back. Along my daily design, we constantly work on the refinement of current system.
