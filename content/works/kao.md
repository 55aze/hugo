### Design system

A well established design system goes beyond traditional style guidelines by incoperating designs with creative technologiest to bulid up a sets of resuable components, guided by clear standards and can be assemble to implement any type of applciations. 


When I first joined the team, all our apps were built based on an open-source frameworks -- react-bootstrap. For developers it's a really convinient way to reuse as much as possible the code snippts. While it's not highly costomizable, and also not comply with the company branding, so we started with existing components and build up a refreshed design guideline and related interactive react components.

### Inventory then create style guides

I did a complete inventory of the exisiting applications first and took down all the UI elements, trying to distinguish the 50 shades of blue or 20 styles of button. Then I cleaned them up and defined the basic style guide, based on which, I also created atomic elements. Those atomics can be then assembled together to create different components in my design. That's what I called "3 levels of design guideline":

#### 3 levels of design guideline

1. **Basic styles**: Color,basic font style and 8px grid system were defined;

2. **Atomics**: Basic UI legos including buttons, forms, icons and etc were created according to the basic style guides;

3. **Components**:
Once the UI legos -- automics are ready, I started to apply them in interface design. While thoes legos, they might look similiar, but it doesn’t necessarily implies that the assembled results will provide the same experience. Along my work, I always pay attention to repeated UX partterns, like "edit profile", "add new" and etc.. These repeated partterns and the way they were presendted by atomics consists of the Components. They should be properly documented why and when to use.

### Evolutionary system

#### Voilà, it's there! But done? No!

Desgin system serves as a guide instead of a dictator, which means designers should refer to it when needed and also should be encourged to contribute back as well. Along my daily design, I constantly working on the refinement of current system.
