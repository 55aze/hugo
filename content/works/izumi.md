Izumi is an end-to-end system built to support the software internationalization process at HERE.
It is important to note that the functionality in Izumi goes beyond that provided by the typical Translation Management Systems (TMS). By going further "upstream" to support design and copywriting processes, and all the way "downstream" to localization testing and continuous integration.
