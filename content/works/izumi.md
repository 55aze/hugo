# What is Izumi?

Early last Spring, I started my career as a Designer in [HERE](https://www.here.com/en) , which provides map services to millions of users all over the world both on their [Phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.here.app.maps&hl=en) or in their cars. 

In such a big international company, **Izumi** is the tool designed to properly localise our products in able to reach out all our users in every corner of the world. I'm the Product Designer specailsed in user experience for such a platform. 

With hundreds of users from both HERE employee to external Localisation Agencies works on this platform on daily base, it is crucial to take into consideration users in the first place.
