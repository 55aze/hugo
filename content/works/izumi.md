# What is Izumi?

Early last Spring, I started my full-time career as a Designer in [HERE](https://www.here.com/en), which provides map services to millions of users all over the world both on their [Phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.here.app.maps&hl=en) or in their cars. 

In such a big international company, **Izumi** is the tool designed to properly localise our products, in able to reach out all our users in every corner of the world. I'm the Product Designer specialised in user experience for such a platform. 

With hundreds of users from both HERE employee to external Localisation agencies work on this platform on the daily base, it is crucial to take into consideration users in the first place.

# Team setting
#### Agile and iterative

- 6 developers 
- 1 product owner
- 3 localisation managers (experts in internationalisation)
- 1 designer (**ME**)
- 2-week sprint, daily stand up catch up

I'm the only designer here in the team, I closely work with peoples from different backgrounds: Front-end experts, business expert and also localisation experts. Also, I'm part of the design community, peer review is also a really good chance to learn from other designers.

# What is Izumi Editview ?

As a localisation platform, Izumi editview is the most used page in users daily life. Below is a simplified lifecycle of localisation process, you could see that the highlighted parts are all done in editview:

#### Wow! Such a long menu on the top, but... as a translator, I just care about where can I finish my translation work !?

So the biggest issue here is that this page is designed for **EVERYBODY**, from editors, copywriters, developers ... to translator and tester. Everybody looks at the exactly same interface and struggle to accomplish their work effectively here.

# Research First!
#### Who is your user and what do they want?

I held 1 to 1 meetings with at least 1 representative in each role, trying to not only took down their complaints about editview but also observe whatâ€™s their natural behaviours and opinions while working.

- 6 peoples
- Internal HERE Employee and External Coperate Agencies
- Semi-structured interview with some test task

#### Some Findings

- Users from external agencies are overwhelmed with the irrelevant and sensitive information and struggle to find their workspace.
- The working process to create a new strings in izumi is tedious, can we automate it? 
- Managers want to have a overall summary of the localisation process, this information is missing.


# Limitations and design brief

I presented these research findings with developers and localisation managers, we distinguished some limitations before we dive into design brief:

- Izumi still requires a lot of manual work, automation relies on API implemetation which is not ready yet
- Due to security reason, external user couldn't 
- An old style guides is applied to izumi, we need to reuse these components as much as possible

#### How might we

- Remove the chaos from the user interface
- Better focus on each user's personal task
- Reflect the localisation in a comprehesive way
- Improve the overall look and feel to ease everybody's life
