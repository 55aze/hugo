## What is Izumi?

Early last Spring, I started my full-time career as a Designer in [HERE](https://www.here.com/en) , which provides map services to millions of users all over the world both on their [Phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.here.app.maps&hl=en) or in their cars. 

In such a big international company, **Izumi** is the tool designed to properly localise our products in able to reach out all our users in every corner of the world. I'm the Product Designer specailsed in user experience for such a platform. 

With hundreds of users from both HERE employee to external Localisation Agencies works on this platform on daily base, it is crucial to take into consideration users in the first place.

## Team setting
#### Agile and iterative

- 6 developers 
- 1 product owner
- 3 localisation managers (experts in internationalisation)
- 1 designer (**ME**)
- 2-week sprint, daily stand up catch up

I'm the only designer here in the team, I closely work with peoples from different backgrounds: Front-end experts, bussiness expert and also localistaion experts. Also I'm part of design community, peer review is also a really good chance to learn from other designers.

## Wow! Such a long menu on the top, but... as a translator, I just care about where can I finish my translation work !?

So the biggest issue here is that this page is designed for **EVERYBODY**, from editors, copywriters, developers ... to translator and tester. Everybody looks at the exactly same interface and struggle to accomplish their work effectively here.
