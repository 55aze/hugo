# What is Izumi?

Early last Spring, I started my full-time career as a Designer in [HERE](https://www.here.com/en), which provides map services to millions of users all over the world both on their [Phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.here.app.maps&hl=en) or in their cars. 

In such a big international company, **Izumi** is the tool designed to properly localise our products, in able to reach out all our users in every corner of the world. I'm the Product Designer specialised in user experience for such a platform. 

With hundreds of users from both HERE employee to external Localisation agencies work on this platform on the daily base, it is crucial to take into consideration users in the first place.

# Team setting
#### Agile and iterative

- 6 developers 
- 1 product owner
- 3 localisation managers (experts in internationalisation)
- 1 designer (**ME**)
- 2-week sprint, daily stand up 

I'm the only designer here in the team, I closely work with peoples from different backgrounds: Front-end experts, business expert and also localisation experts. Also, I'm part of the design community, peer review is also a really good chance to learn from other designers.

# Why do we need a dashboard?

Several years ago, izmui was seeded by 2 developers with really basic functions. In the past several years, a lot of new features were added. It became more and more powerful while in the meantime, we also heard more and more compliants:

> "Hey, where can I change the language settings for this project? "
> "Where can I import strings in json file?"
> "Can I create a new user? How and where?"

The hardly(zero) designed navigation system is a big issue, while it is a complex system, there're some main concepts which are not properly clarified in Izumi:

- #### Platform VS Project


- #### Internal VS External
