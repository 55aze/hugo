<h2 id="what-is-izumi">What is Izumi?</h2>

<p>Early 2017, I started my full-time job as a UX Designer in <a href="https://www.here.com/en">HERE</a>. For a big international company,it is critical to make the products accessible to users across the world. <strong>Izumi</strong> is the tool we&rsquo;ve built internally to help designers and external agencies to manage and monitor product localisation workflow. With hundreds of users with more than 7 different roles working actively on this platform on a daily base, it is crucial to put users&rsquo; needs in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="team-setting">Team setting</h2>

<h4 id="agile-and-iterative">Agile and iterative</h4>

<ul>
<li>6 developers</li>
<li>1 product owner</li>
<li>3 localisation managers (experts in internationalisation)</li>
<li>1 designer (Me)</li>
<li>2-week sprint, daily stand up catch up</li>
</ul>

<p>As the only designer in the team, I worked closely with people from different backgrounds: Front-end experts, business experts and localisation experts. Also, I&rsquo;m part of the design community, peer review is also a really good chance to learn from other designers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-izumi-editview">What is Izumi Editview ?</h2>

<p>As a localisation platform, Izumi Editview is the most used page in users daily life. Below is a simplified lifecycle of localisation process, you could see that the highlighted parts are all done in Editview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow! Such a long menu on the top, but&hellip; as a translator, I just care about where can I finish my translation work !?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the biggest issue here is that this page is designed for <strong>EVERYBODY</strong>, from editors, copywriters, developers &hellip; to translator and tester. Everybody looks at the exact same interface and struggle to finish their work here.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="research-first">Research First!</h2>

<h4 id="who-is-your-user-and-what-do-they-want">Who is your user and what do they want?</h4>

<p>I talked with 6 peoples, at least 1 representative in each role, including HERE employees and external agencies users, trying to not only took down their complaints about Editview but also observe whatâ€™s their natural behaviours and opinions while working.</p>

<h4 id="some-findings">Some Findings</h4>

<ul>
<li>External users are overwhelmed with the irrelevant and sensitive information, struggle to focus on their work</li>
<li>The working process to create a new string in Izumi is tedious for designers</li>
<li>Managers want to have an overview of localisation process which is unclear in current Izumi</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="limitations-and-design-brief">Limitations and design brief</h2>

<p>I presented these research findings with developers and localisation managers, we distinguished some limitations and wrote down the design brief:</p>

<h4 id="how-might-we">How might we</h4>

<ul>
<li>Remove the chaos from user interface</li>
<li>Customize the user interface for different roles</li>
<li>Clearly reflect the localisation status for manangers</li>
<li>Improve the overall look and feel to make it looks consistent and clean</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>

<p>To help users focus on their own tasks, we tried to categorize izumi workflow in 3 different stages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Authoring</strong>: Desginers and copywriters need to create and approve UI strings for translation, Authoring is their working space</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Translation</strong>: When strings are ready for translation, project manager will send them out to external agencies. Translators and external agency managers will work in translation stage;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: The same as translation, when translation is done, testers and agency managers will test the results in testing stage.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on different user roles, people will see different user interface which help them only to only focus on their tasks.</p>

<h2 id="ui-design">UI Design</h2>

<p>I worked with front-end developer together created an universal style guide called &ldquo;<a href="/works/kao">kao</a>&rdquo;, which contains style, atomics and react-based components.</p>



<figure class="pointer dim link bn">
    <a href="/works/kao" class="bn">
        <img src="/img/works/kao.png"  />
    </a>

<div class="show">
    <div class="overlay"></div>
    <div class="img-show">
      <span>X</span>
      <img src="">
    </div>
</div>


<p>A good design system really helped me to smoothly communicate with developers and also ensured that I could always take consideration the overall look and feel to keep consistent with my old designs.</p>

</div>


<h2 id="test-and-iterations">Test and Iterations</h2>

<p>After deployed this new version of edit view, I sat with several HERE designers and copywriter when they were using Izumi edtiview to finish their work. In general users are happy with this refreshment, still they&rsquo;re complaing it requires a lot of tedious and manual work.</p>

<p>For the next step, I&rsquo;m looking forward to combine design tools together with Izumi. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>&rdquo; is a quite good example, it provides all the required information for creating a string, once the Izumi API is ready, it&rsquo;s possible to automate this process.</p>

To be honest, I was totally overwhelmed by the initial desig -->
