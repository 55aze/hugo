<h1 id="what-is-izumi">What is Izumi?</h1>

<p>Early last Spring, I started my full-time career as a Designer in <a href="https://www.here.com/en">HERE</a>, which provides map services to millions of users all over the world both on their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.here.app.maps&amp;hl=en">Phones</a> or in their cars.</p>

<p>In such a big international company, <strong>Izumi</strong> is the tool designed to properly localise our products, in able to reach out all our users in every corner of the world. I&rsquo;m the Product Designer specialised in user experience for such a platform.</p>

<p>With hundreds of users from both HERE employee to external Localisation agencies work on this platform on the daily base, it is crucial to take into consideration users in the first place.</p>

<h1 id="team-setting">Team setting</h1>

<h4 id="agile-and-iterative">Agile and iterative</h4>

<ul>
<li>6 developers</li>
<li>1 product owner</li>
<li>3 localisation managers (experts in internationalisation)</li>
<li>1 designer (<strong>ME</strong>)</li>
<li>2-week sprint, daily stand up</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m the only designer here in the team, I closely work with peoples from different backgrounds: Front-end experts, business expert and also localisation experts. Also, I&rsquo;m part of the design community, peer review is also a really good chance to learn from other designers.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="why-do-we-need-a-dashboard">Why do we need a dashboard?</h1>

<p>Izmui was seeded by 2 developers with basic functions several years ago. In the past several years, a lot of new features were added. It became more and more powerful while in the meantime, we also heard more and more compliants:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where can I change the language settings for this project? &ldquo;
&ldquo;Where can I import strings in json file?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can I create a new user? How and where?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The navigation system is a big issue, while it is a complex system, there&rsquo;re some main concepts which are not properly clarified in Izumi:</p>

<h4 id="platform-vs-project">Platform VS Project</h4>

<p>As shown below, currently we just throw all menu items into the top menu bar in Izumi. When you switch your roles or projects in izumi, some of the items will be hidden or shown. So I always heard people are complaining they can&rsquo;t find the item they&rsquo;re looking for, this even happened to me several times.</p>



<figure class="popup pointer">
    
        <img src="/img/works/project-platform.png"  />
    
</figure>
<div class="show">
    <div class="overlay"></div>
    <div class="img-show">
      <span>X</span>
      <img src="">
    </div>
</div>


<h4 id="design-space">Design Space</h4>

<p>It seems like we didn&rsquo;t properly structure our contents in Izumi.</p>

<h1 id="concentrate-on-users-needs">Concentrate on users&rsquo; needs</h1>

<p>I explored several ways to help me sort out all the informations logaically. One interesting method &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="https://alistapart.com/article/object-oriented-ux">OOUX</a>&rdquo; borrowed the idea in programming and treat your design content as an object. These objects could contain meta data, links and another or more objects, which helps you better understand how each object interact with others.</p>

<p>I applied this method in Izumi design as well:</p>

<p>Then I figured out that it&rsquo;s too much information for me to digest since we have 10 different users, I decide to come back to basic &ndash; <strong>Concentrate on User&rsquo;s Needs</strong></p>

<p>I took an <strong>application distilling</strong> process for each user, it helps me distinguished the most important sections to include in the dashboard for different users.</p>

<h4 id="how-did-i-do-that">How did I do that?</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Went through every user&rsquo;s (10 in total) use cases in Izumi, wrote down all user scenarios and corresponding flows first;</p></li>

<li><p>Then look into these flows, try to distinguish the neccessary &ldquo;features&rdquo;, &ldquo;navigations&rdquo; and &ldquo;metrics&rdquo; blocks to accomplish these flows;</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, get together everybody&rsquo;s blocks, try to categorize them and arrange them in different pages;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After the second step, I could already get the desired blocks for users, below is an example for designer:</p>

<p>By the end of this exercise, I can pick out the most important blocks for each users and also already could have some ideas about how to structure them:</p>
